            Arthur: Whoa there!<br>
            Guard #1: Who goes there?<br>
            Arthur: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!<br>
            Guard #1: Pull the other one!<br>
            Arthur: I am. And this is my trusty servant Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of kngihts who will join me in my court of Camelot. I must speak with your lord and master.<br>
            Guard #1: What, ridden on a horse?<br>
            Arthur: Yes!<br>
            Guard #1: Your're using coconuts!<br>
            Arthur: What?<br>
            Guard #1: You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em together.<br>
            Arthur: So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, trhough the kingdom of Mercea, though --<br>
            Guard #1: Where'd you get the coconut?<br>
            Arthur: We found them.<br>
            Guard #1: Found them? In Mercea? The coconut's tropical!<br>
            Arthur: What do you mean?<br>
            Guard #1: Well, this is a temperate zone.<br>
            Arthur: The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plumber may seek warmer climes in winter yet these are not strangers to our land.<br>
            Guard #1: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?<br>
            Arthur: Not at all, they could be carried.<br>
            Guard #1: What -- a swallow carrying a coconut?<br>
            Arthur: It could grip it by the husk!<br>
            Guard #1: It's not a question of where he grips it! It's a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not carry a 1 pound coconut. <br>
            Arthur: Well, it doesn't matter. Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.<br>
            Guard #1: Listen, in order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right?<br>
            Arthur: Please!<br>
            Guard #1: Am I right?<br>
            Arthur: I'm not interested!<br>
            Guard #2: It could be carried by an African swallow!<br>
            Guard #1: Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow, that's my point.<br>
            Guard #2: Oh, yeah, I agree with that...<br>
            Arthur: Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?!<br>
            GUARD #1:  But then of course African swallows are not migratory.<br>
            GUARD #2:  Oh, yeah...<br>
            GUARD #1:  So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway...<br>
            GUARD #2:  Wait a minute -- supposing two swallows carried it together?<br>
            GUARD #1:  No, they'd have to have it on a line.<br>
            GUARD #2:  Well, simple!  They'd just use a standard creeper!<br>
            GUARD #1:  What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?<br>
            GUARD #2:  Well, why not?<br>
